\title{IN2349 ADLR: Project Ideas}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

Here you can find a number of ideas for projects we collected. Take this as an inspiration for your own project. Some of the ideas are rather "big", meaning they could result in more than one project. After you have registered your team (including a draft proposal) you will discuss the extent of your final proposal with your assigned tutor.


\subsubsection{Comparing Methods for Uncertainty Estimation}
Interesting methods include (but are not limited to) MC-Dropoout \cite{Gal2016}, Bootstrapping \cite{Osband2018}, and Normalizing Flows \cite{louizos2017multiplicative}. Thsese methods could be compared in vastly different settings.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigate how the uncertainty estimation changes during the training process (relevant to RL since we generally donâ€™t update the networks until convergence before collecting more data).
  \item Investigate which methods are best suited for active learning in the framework proposed by \cite{gal2017active}.
  \item Investigate which methods perform best for DQNs in simple environments similar (\cite{BSuit2020}, \cite{touati2018randomized}).
  \item Come up with your own ideas.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Offline Datasets for Reinforcement Learning}
Offline (or Batch) RL has recently gained more and more attention, \cite{Agarwal2019}, \cite{nair2020} (cf. \url{https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2019/12/05/bear}).
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compare differnt Batch RL algorithms.
  \item Test new environments.
  \item Benchmark against online algorithms.
\end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Geometric Representations in Reinforcement Learning}
% Note: Requires previous experience with GNNs \cite{kipf2016semisupervised}.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Similar to \cite{Wang2018nervenet}. Modify PyBullet environments (Hopper, Walker, HalfCheetah, Ant) such that the observations contain a graph representing the robot.
%   \item Use message passing network(s) in addition or instead of the MLP for value/Q function and policy in standard algorithms like PPO \cite{Schulman2017} or SAC \cite{Haarnoja2018a}.
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Closing the Sim-to-Real Loop: Adapting Simulation Randomization with Real World Experience}
In~\cite{Chebotar2018} an efficient method for solving the sim2real problem by iteratively adapting the simulation parameters to the real system is proposed.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Change the experimental setup to a sim2sim setting because no real robot is available (i.e., try to adapt one simulation to a given one with unknown parameters).
  \item Investigate the convergence of estimated parameters.
  \item Investigate the influence of a broader starting distribution on the final performance.
  \item Investigate how re-using learned policies from previous iterations for initialization of the new network shortens training time and restrains the final performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Meta Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-real Domain Adaptation}
\cite{Arndt19} show that the sim2real problem can be tackled by applying Meta RL to learned low dimensional projections of the action space.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement the algorithm
  \item Change the experimental setup to a sim2sim setting because no real robot is available (i.e., try to adapt one simulation to a given one with unknown parameters).
  \item Investigate how this framework can be applied or extended to classic closed-loop robot control
\end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{Solving Complex Sparse Reinforcement Learning Tasks}
% When defining Reinforcement Learning Tasks for robots, it is often desirable to stick to sparse rewards in order to avoid reward shaping. Not only does is it ease the setup since a task can be solely defined by its final desired outcome, but the optimal policy can be found "outside of the box" without a human prior given through the reward function. Unfortunately, in big state spaces random exploration is not able to find these sparse success signals. Therefore, \cite{riedmiller2018} introduce SAC-X.
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Implement the algorithm
%   \item Investigate how the presented method can be used for finer and more dexterous object manipulation e.g. with a hand.
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learning the Inverse Kinematic}
Look at the possibilities for representing inverse problems with neural networks.
\textit{Analyzing Inverse Problems with Invertible Neural Networks}~\cite{Ardizzone2018}
compare different flavors of GANs, VAEs and INN(theirs) for inverse problems in general. Extend their simple robotic example of a planner arm to 3D / more DoFs / multiple TCPs.
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is the best approach to represent the high dimensional nullspaces for complex robot geometries?
  \item Predict not only the position of the TCP but also the rotation. Connection to continuous rotation representation ~\cite{Zhou2018}.
  \item How to measure the performance if the real nullspace is not known?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Harnessing Reinforcement Learning for Neural Motion Planning}
Motion planning for a planar robotic arm from a start configuration to a cartesian goal position. Comparison between DDPG, DDPG+HER, and DDPG-MP(theirs) ~\cite{Jurgenson2019}.
They use RRT* to generate expert knowledge in difficult cases, where random exploration does not find a feasible solution.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Modify the code and try it for different robots and environments.
  \item They state that supervised learning is inferior to RL for this problem because of the insufficient data on the boundary of the obstacles. Is it possible to achieve similar results by tweaking the distribution of the supervised examples?
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Learning to Optimize Motion Planning}
Explore the ideas proposed by "Learning to Optimize" ~\cite{LiM16b} in the context of optimization based motion planning \cite{Zucker2013}. Can RL guide an optimzer to speed up robotic path planning?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Set up an optimizer for a simple robot (with help from the tutor)
  \item Test ideas to guide the optimizer with RL
  \item What are advantages of this hybrid approach over using RL directly on motion planning
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Recurrent Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning in POMDPs}
In partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), a RL agent has to be equipped with some sort of memory in order to be able to act optimally. A well known method addressing this issue is to encode the history of observations by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
For the class of Off-Policy methods, \cite{heess2015memory} combine RNNs with the DDPG algorithm and \cite{kapturowski2018recurrent} study the interplay of DQN-based algorithms with recurrent experience replay.
Based on these works:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement POMDP environments that require the use of memory to be solved optimally.
  \item Implement a recurrent version of the SAC algorithm (\cite{Haarnoja2018a}).
  \item Assess the effect of different design choices and hyperparameters (e.g. hidden state initialization strategy in the experience replay buffer, truncated BPTT, ...)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Differentiable Bayesian Filters}
Differentiable filters are a promising approach for combining the algorithmic structure of bayesian filter techniques with the power of learning-based methods (for an overview over existing methods, see e.g. \cite{kloss2021train}). Importantly, differentiable filters offer a systematic way of dealing with aleatoric uncertainty in state estimation problems.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement a differentiable Filter of your choice, for example EKF, UKF or Particle Filter.
  \item Consider the simple tracking experiment VI from \cite{kloss2021train}. Implement interesting modification to the experiment. For example:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item use the distance to beacons instead of images as measurements
          \item implement collisions
          \item additionally estimate parameters from the system dynamics on-the-fly
        \end{itemize}
  \item Compare your filter to recurrent neural networks and discuss the benefits.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exploring Munchausen Reinforcement Learning}
Recently, \cite{vieillard2020munchausen} proposed an appealingly simple, yet surprisingly effective extension to DQN; using the policy for bootstrapping. Exploring the implications of this idea, projects could for example address a (sub) set of the following problems:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend the idea to continuous action spaces (e.g. by augmenting SAC).
  \item Apply Munchausen RL to robotic tasks and see what it brings to the table. Does it improve the baselines? If yes, under what circumstances? If no, investigate the causes.
  \item Come up with adaptive strategies to deal with the additional hyperparameters introduced by \cite{vieillard2020munchausen}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unsupervised Skill Discovery / Curiosity}
Pretraining neural networks in an unsupervised setting showed to be extremely effective for language models. Similarly, RL agents can be pretrained in an environment with different goals in mind. Projects in this direction could (reimplement/) validate one of the papers below in the PyBullet physics simulator, and extent their work with interesting ablation studies or algorithmic modifications.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cite{Plan2Explore2020}
  \item \cite{DADS2020}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Policy Adaptation during Deployment}
Training RL agents in simulation can accelerate learning substantially, and may sometimes be the only viable option due to hardware constraints. However, it is difficult to model the system in simulation accuratly enough such that trained policies also work in the real world. \cite{Hansen2021} propse to close this sim2real gap using self-supervision during delpoyment.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Validate the proposed algorithm in a sim2sim setting.
  \item If everything works correctly we can also run real world experiments with Justin's DLR Hand II.
\end{itemize}
